                    <p>
                      Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding
                      Crohn’s disease can help you and your loved ones navigate the uncertainty that comes with a new
                      diagnosis. Crohn’s disease belongs to a group of conditions known as inflammatory bowel diseases,
                      or IBD. It is named after Dr. Burrill B. Crohn, who first described the disease in 1932 along with
                      his colleagues, Dr. Leon Ginzburg and Dr. Gordon D. Oppenheimer

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        💡 IBD affects an estimated 3 million Americans. Men and women are equally likely to be affected
                        by Crohn's disease.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 The disease can occur at any age, but Crohn’s disease is most often diagnosed in adolescents
                        and adults between the ages of 20 and 30.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Studies have shown that between 1.5 percent and 28 percent of people with IBD have a
                        first-degree relative, such as a parent, child, or sibling, who also has one of the diseases.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Even though there is genetic component associated with increased risk of IBD, it is
                        impossible to predict who may get Crohn’s disease based on family history.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Crohn’s disease can affect people from all ethnic backgrounds. The disease is more common in
                        Caucasians, though the rates of Crohn’s disease have increased among Hispanics and Asians in
                        recent years.

                      <li>
                        💡 The disease can occur at any age, but Crohn’s disease is most prevalent in adolescents and
                        adults between the ages of 15 and 35.
                      </li>
                      <li>💡 Diet and stress may aggravate Crohn’s disease, but do not cause the disease.</li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Recent research suggests hereditary, genetic, and environmental factors contribute to Crohn’s
                        disease development.

                    </ul>
                    <br /> <h2>Crohn’s Disease and the Immune System</h2>
                    <p>
                      A person’s immune system usually attacks and kills foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, fungi,
                      and other microorganisms. During a normal immune response, cells travel out of the blood to the
                      intestines and produce inflammation. Under normal circumstances, harmless bacteria that’s present
                      in the GI tract are protected from an immune system attack.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2>In people with IBD:</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        💡 These harmless bacteria are mistaken for foreign invaders and the immune system mounts a
                        response.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 The inflammation caused by the immune response does not go away. This leads to chronic
                        inflammation, ulceration, thickening of the intestinal wall, and, eventually, symptoms of
                        Crohn’s disease.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                     <h2 id='define-new-section'>Genetic Factors</h2>
                    <p>
                      Crohn’s disease tends to run in families, so if you or a close relative has the disease, your
                      family members have an increased chance of developing Crohn’s. Studies have shown that between 5%
                      and 20% of people with IBD have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, child, or sibling, who
                      also has one of the diseases. The genetic risk is greater with Crohn’s disease than ulcerative
                      colitis.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Other Genetic Risk Factors</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        💡 The risk of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis is substantially higher when both parents
                        have IBD.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 The disease is most common among people of eastern European backgrounds, including Jews of
                        European descent.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 There have been an increased number of cases reported in African-American populations in
                        recent years.

                    <h2>Crohn’s Disease Complications</h2>
                    <p>
                      While Crohn’s disease is located in the GI tract, it can affect your overall health and cause more
                      serious medical issues.

                      <li>
                        💡 Fissures are tears in the lining of the anus, which can cause pain and bleeding especially
                        during bowel movements.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 A fistula, caused by inflammation, is an abnormal channel that forms between one part of the
                        intestine and another, or between the intestine and the bladder, vagina, or skin. Fistulas are
                        most common in the anal area and require immediate medical attention.

                    <br /> <h2>Crohn’s Disease Diagnosis and Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                      Crohn’s disease has a wide range of symptoms that vary from person to person. We are by your side
                      as you navigate the diagnostic process, letting you know what to expect each step of the way.
                      There is no single test to confirm a Crohn’s diagnosis, and Crohn’s disease symptoms are often
                      similar to other conditions, including bacterial infection. Your healthcare providers should
                      evaluate your current medical history and use information from diagnostic testing to exclude other
                      potential causes of your symptoms. This process can take some time. If you feel you or your loved
                      one are experiencing symptoms that could be Crohn's disease, be sure to see your doctor as soon as
                      possible.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Initial Testing and Evaluation</h2>
                    <p>
                      The first step to diagnosis and treatment is a standard physical exam of your body. Your doctor
                      will speak to you and ask questions about your overall health, diet and nutrition, family history,
                      and your daily routine.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2 id='define-new-section'>What to Expect</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        💡 Your doctor may order diagnostic testing to look for signs of Crohn’s disease and rule out
                        other possible medical conditions.
                      </li>
                      <li>💡 Your first tests will likely include laboratory tests of your blood and stool.</li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Further testing could include X-rays of the upper and lower GI tract. Your doctor may
                        recommend a test that uses a contrast chemical that helps your doctors see a more clear and
                        detailed picture of your GI tract. The type of contrast used varies by test.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Consider bringing a trusted family member or close friend to your appointments. This may help
                        ease your stress and help you later remember information from your doctor.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        💡 Write down your symptoms and bring it to your appointments, so you don’t have to worry about
                        forgetting anything important.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Ask your healthcare team which test is best for you, and contact your insurance to understand
                        coverage of costs.

                    <p>
                      Your doctor may recommend additional testing to look inside your GI tract and intestine. While
                      these tests are more invasive and may sound frightening, they are often done in an outpatient
                      setting and your health care providers will be careful to minimize any discomfort.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2 id='define-new-section'>Endoscopy</h2>
                    <p>
                      Your doctor may recommend an endoscopy to get a detailed look at the inside of your colon using a
                      small camera mounted to the end of a lighted tube.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        💡 A colonoscopy allows doctors to examine the colon, the lowest part of your large intestine,
                        by inserting a flexible, lighted tube through the opening to your anus.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 An upper endoscopy lets doctors see the gastrointestinal tract from the top down, using a
                        flexible, lighted tube that’s inserted through your mouth, down the esophagus, into your stomach
                        and as far down as the duodenum, which is the first section of your small intestine.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Colonoscopies require bowel preparation. Talk to your healthcare team about ways to prepare, and
                      tips for making this preparation easier.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2>Biopsy</h2>
                    <p>
                      Your doctor may want to get a biopsy of your colon or another area of your GI tract while
                      performing a colonoscopy or endoscopy. During the biopsy, a small piece of tissue is removed from

                      These tests are used to examine portions of your intestine that can’t be easily seen by
                      colonoscopy or endoscopy. They work by using an oral contrast that you drink and that can be seen
                      on a fluoroscopic X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI).

                    <h1>Crohn's Disease Treatment Options</h1>
                    <p>
                      A combination of treatment options can help you stay in control of your disease and help you to
                      lead a full and rewarding life. Remember that there is no standard treatment that will work for
                      all patients. Each patient’s situation is different and treatment must be followed for each
                      circumstance. Treatment for Crohn’s disease and other IBD varieties can include the use of
                      medication, alterations in diet and nutrition, and sometimes surgical procedures to repair or
                      remove affected portions of your GI tract.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2>Medication</h2>
                    <p>
                      Medication treating Crohn’s disease is designed to suppress your immune system’s abnormal
                      inflammatory response that is causing your symptoms. Suppressing inflammation not only offers
                      relief from common symptoms like fever, diarrhea, and pain, it also allows your intestinal tissues
                      to heal.
                      <br />
                      In addition to controlling and suppressing symptoms (inducing remission), medication can also be
                      used to decrease the frequency of symptom flare ups (maintaining remission). With proper treatment
                      over time, periods of remission can be extended and periods of symptom flare ups can be reduced.
                      Several types of medication are being used to treat Crohn's disease today.
                      <br />
                      <h3>Combination Therapy</h3>
                      In some circumstances, a health care provider may recommend adding an additional therapy that will
                      work in combination with the initial therapy to increase its effectiveness. For example,
                      combination therapy could include the addition of a biologic to an immunomodulator. As with all
                      therapy, there are risks and benefits of combination therapy. Combining therapies can increase the
                      effectiveness of IBD treatment, but there may also be an increased risk of additional side effects
                      and toxicity. Your health care provider will identify the treatment option that is most effective
                      for your individual health care needs.
                    </p>
                    <br /> <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
                    <p>
                      While Crohn’s disease may not be the result of bad reactions to specific foods, paying special
                      attention to your diet may help reduce symptoms, replace lost nutrients, and promote healing. For
                      people diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, it is essential to maintain good nutrition because Crohn’s
                      often reduces your appetite while increasing your body’s energy needs. Additionally, common
                      Crohn’s symptoms like diarrhea can reduce your body’s ability to absorb protein, fat,
                      carbohydrates, as well as water, vitamins, and minerals. Many people who experience Crohn's
                      disease flare ups find that soft, bland foods cause less discomfort than spicy or high-fiber
                      foods. While your diet can remain flexible and should include a variety of foods from all food
                      groups, your doctor will likely recommend restricting your intake of dairy if you are found to be
                      lactose-intolerant. Watch this webcast to learn more about nutrition in inflammatory bowel

                    <br /> <h2>Surgery</h2>
                    <p>
                      Even with proper medication and diet, as many as two-thirds to three-quarters of people with
                      Crohn's disease will require surgery at some point during their lives. While surgery does not cure
                      Crohn's disease, it can conserve portions of your GI tract and return you to the best possible
                      quality of life. Surgery becomes necessary when medications can no longer control symptoms, or if
                      you develop a fistula, fissure, or intestinal obstruction. Surgery often involves removal of the
                      diseased segment of bowel (resection), the two ends of healthy bowel are then joined together
                      (anastomosis). While these procedures may cause your symptoms to disappear for many years, Crohn’s
                      frequently recurs later in life.
                    </p>

                      <li>
                        💡 Over a span of 5 years, studies have shown that 18% of Crohn's patients may eventually
                        require surgery. This percentage has significantly declined within the last several years.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 Different types of procedures may be performed depending on the reason, severity of illness,
                        and location of the disease.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        💡 For Crohn's disease patients, approximately 31% may require a second resection 10 years after
                        their first resection.
