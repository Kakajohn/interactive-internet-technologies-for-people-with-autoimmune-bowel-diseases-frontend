                have led to a more effective treatment and improvement of the course of this category of
                diseases.Autoimmune diseases are mainly due to risk factors associated with lifestyle and diet. "As
                these factors are variable, that is, they can change, targeted medical interventions in lifestyle and
                diet, lead to a substantial improvement in the course of the disease, as well as to improving the
                quality of life of people who have developed autoimmune disease."

                Autoimmune diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases that occur when the body attacks and destroys its
                own cells and organs. More specifically, it is the leading cause of chronic illnesses and affects the
                health of most people more than it affects heart disease and cancer combined. The human body's immune
                system plays a key role in maintaining good health. However, there are cases where he confuses his role
                and ends up treating elements of the organization as his enemy. As a result of autoimmune diseases, of
                which 5% of the population suffers.

                The defense (immune) system in combination with the neuro-aesthetic system determine and maintain the
                integrity of the body. The immune system is made up of cells that circulate in the blood and are found
                in almost all tissues. Using a complex system is a function that constantly receives stimuli of
                different types, communicating in parallel with the nervous and endocrine systems.

                Autoimmune diseases are manifested by the manifestation of various symptoms, such as fever, malaise or
                pain in the joints, rash or hypertension. In general, they are chronic diseases that show exacerbations
                and relapses. The earlier they are diagnosed, the better their response to medication. Tissue damage
                heals and the disease remains in remission for years.

                To date, more than 150 different autoimmune diseases have been identified with the common denominator of
                immune system dysfunction. Autoimmune diseases are diseases that quite often require taking life-saving
                medications. Until recently, their treatment and treatment was mainly symptomatic and aimed at reducing
                inflammation and suppressing the immune system.

                The exact cause of idiopathic bowel disease has not yet been discovered. However, the prevailing view is
                that it is due to the fact that environmental factors (eg childhood health, smoking, diet, infections,
                breastfeeding, drugs) in combination with genetically predisposed individuals affect the intestinal
                microbial population causing immune disorders. They have a variety of symptoms, both in the digestive
                system and in other organs of the body. The intensity of the symptoms is proportional to the extent of
                the intestinal tract involvement.

                Treatment includes a variety of drugs that are used alone or in combination. Many patients are often
                asked for nutritional support with elementary and polymer diets, while some patients will need surgery.
                The challenge in treatment is to move from a strategic symptom relief and maintenance recession to an
                aggressive one aimed at the complete cure of intestinal inflammation, thus seeking to change the natural
                course of the disease. Of course the approach differs from patient to patient and differs based on
                various factors.

                Idiopathic intestinal diseases are one of the biggest challenges in the medical field and especially in
                gastroenterology. Treatment with biological agents has successfully changed the treatment of
                inflammation, today diseases are almost treatable through proper treatment or surgery, with the result
                that most people continue a healthy normal life. Of particular interest are the genetic tests and
                studies, where there is already a great deal of progress at the research level in terms of recognition
                and understanding resulting in the production of new drugs.
