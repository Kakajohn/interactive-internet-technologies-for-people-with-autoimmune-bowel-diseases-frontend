                      Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited disorder characterized by cancer of the large
                      intestine (colon ) and rectum. People with the classic type of familial adenomatous polyposis may
                      begin to develop multiple noncancerous (benign) growths (polyps ) in the colon as early as their
                      teenage years. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare, inherited condition caused by a
                      defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Most people inherit the gene from a parent.
                      But for 25 to 30 percent of people, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously. FAP causes extra
                      tissue (polyps) to form in your large intestine (colon) and rectum. Polyps can also occur in the
                      upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). If
                      untreated, the polyps in the colon and rectum are likely to become cancerous when you are in your
                      40s.
                      <p id='symptoms'></p>Most people with familial adenomatous polyposis eventually neFnaved surgery
                      to remove the large intestine to prevent cancer. The polyps in the duodenum also can develop
                      cancer, but they can usually be managed by careful monitoring and by removing polyps regularly.
                      Some people have a milder form of the condition, called attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis
                      (AFAP). People with AFAP usually have fewer colon polyps (an average of 30) and develop cancer
                      later in life.

                    <p>
                      The main sign of FAP is hundreds or even thousands of polyps growing in your colon and rectum,
                      usually starting by your mid-teens. The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into
                      colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s Familial adenomatous polyposis is
                      caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent. But some people develop the
                      abnormal gene that causes the condition.{' '}

                    <p>
                      Your risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or
                      sister with the condition.

                          cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed

                      You're at risk of familial adenomatous polyposis if you have a parent, child, brother or sister
                      with the condition. If you're at risk, it's important to be screened frequently, starting in
                      childhood. Annual exams can detect the growth of polyps before they become cancerous.
                      <br />
                      <h3>Screening</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ Sigmoidoscopy. A flexible tube is inserted into your rectum to inspect the rectum and
                          sigmoid â€” the last two feet of the colon. For people with a genetic diagnosis of FAP or family
                          members at risk who haven't had genetic testing, the American College of Gastroenterology
                          recommends annual sigmoidoscopy, beginning at ages 10 to12 years. <br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ Colonoscopy. A flexible tube is inserted into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. Once
                          polyps are found in your colon, you need to have an annual colonoscopy until you have surgery
                          to remove your colon. <br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and side-viewing duodenoscopy. Two types of scopes are
                          used to inspect your esophagus, stomach and upper part of the small intestine (duodenum and
                          ampulla). The doctor may remove a small tissue sample (biopsy) for further study. <br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ CT or MRI. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis may be used, especially to evaluate desmoid
                          tumors.

                    <p>
                      A simple blood test can determine if you carry the abnormal gene that causes FAP. Genetic testing
                      may also detect whether you're at risk of complications of FAP. Your doctor may suggest genetic
                      testing if:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ You have family members with FAP <br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ You have some, but not all, of the signs of FAP <br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ðŸ’¡ Ruling out FAP spares at-risk children years of screening and emotional distress. For
                          children who do carry the gene, appropriate screening and treatment greatly reduce the risk of
                          cancer.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2 id='define-new-section'>Additional tests</h2>
                    <p>
                      Your doctor may recommend thyroid exams and other tests to detect other medical problems that can
                      occur if you have FAP.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      At first, your doctor will remove any small polyps found during your colonoscopy exam. Eventually,
                      though, the polyps will become too numerous to remove individually, usually by your late teens or
                      early 20s. Then you will need surgery to prevent colon cancer. You will also need surgery if a
                      polyp is cancerous. You may not need surgery for AFAP.

                    <p>
                      Your surgeon may decide to perform your surgery laparoscopically, through several small incisions
                      that require just a stitch or two to close. This minimally invasive surgery usually shortens your
                      hospital stay and allows you to recover more quickly.

                      <p>
                        Depending on your situation, you may have one of the following types of surgery to remove part

                      Surgery doesn't cure FAP. Polyps can continue to form in the remaining or reconstructed parts of
                      your colon, stomach and small intestine. Depending on the number and size of the polyps, having
                      them removed endoscopically may not be enough to reduce your risk of cancer. You may need
                      additional surgery.
