                Medical Informatics therefore has the content of basic research, clinical medicine, and health service
                organization. In recent years it has escaped the narrow confines of the design and implementation of
                information systems and is a comprehensive, analytical, and rational method of approaching medical
                research and practice. By the term medical informatics, we refer to all the information technologies
                (computer systems, databases, software, multimedia applications, etc.) used in the provision of health
                services and in medical education. The term telemedicine refers to the use of telecommunications to
                provide the above health and education services. Due to the fact that most telemedicine applications
                involve and rely on the use of medical information components, it is often difficult to distinguish
                between the two. Of course the end users of the system, patients and doctors should not be preoccupied
                with such differences, as we will see for them the system they use must be "transparent" from a
                technological point of view. This means that all they are interested in is, any telemedicine system, to
                provide them with a set of facilities (services) and they can use these services without having to know
                or deal with the technical details of the implementation, for example with the transmission rate
                provided by the telecommunications organization or with the protocols of a network.

                Some services offered by medical IT such as teleconferencing which provides the possibility for
                audiovisual contact between remote points using cameras and microphones as well as network equipment.
                Thus, doctors can carry out medical consultations between the hospitals of the area, diagnose patients
                from another hospital and provide advice to non-specialized doctors or doctors of other specialties.
                This is crucial in the case of remote health centers as well as in dealing with emergencies. The
                following options are also offered to the doctor:

              <ul>
                <li>• Diagnose the patient remotely</li>
                <li>• Can consult a specialist colleague about the patient being examined.</li>
                <li>• Direct access to the patient file</li>
                <li>• Reduction of diagnosis time</li>
                <li>• Immediate information and briefing</li>
                <li>• Direct communication with colleagues through a network</li>
              </ul>
