  First of all Home is where the user is redirect after a succesfull **Login** or **Register**. Is the homepage

 The **Articles** section contains articles about **F.A.P.** and **Crohn**. It's writen in steps, that means that it begins with an **Overview**

 the same way for both diseases. 

 **Note** that all information is as accurate as they can be and they are collected from medical books with the help oof George Loufopoulos (Military doctor).
