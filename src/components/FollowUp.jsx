                      In this section we will discuss how useful its services are at home to people with chronic diseases.
                      Unfortunately, there are many chronic diseases that need constant medical attention. Changes in weight,
                      pulse, oxygen levels in the blood can be life issues that need to be diagnosed and treated immediately
                      by our doctor. What if we are alone at home or our own are unable to help us and the distance from the
                      nearest hospital is long? Our solution is provided by remote monitoring of the patient.

                      The effort is facilitated by the development of technology and the reduction of the cost of electronic
                      boards (chips) in combination with the increase of the data transmission speed through telephone,
                      network or wireless networks. The spread of modern technology to the general public has familiarized
                      patients with the use of the internet and has brought them closer to current events and developments in
                      medicine. The benefits of home patient monitoring are many.

                        • Special chip implanted under the skin and identified by a special manual scanner, which detects a
                        number that is unique to each patient and refers to the patient's electronic medical history.
